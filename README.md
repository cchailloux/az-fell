# The Project

Make a website for the A. Z. Fell bookshop in Soho, London indicating whether the shop is currently opened or not (most likely not).

## Project advancement

### DONE

- translate English words (occasionally, perhaps, etc.) into probability
- with it, determine for today if the shop is a) open at all b) opening at what time c) closing at what time
- resize video when window changes

### TODO

- handle bank holidays
- tailor the messages
- decide the luck server-side so everybody has the same experience ?
- transform in a 2-step process : display still photo with text and button, if user clicks then play video / message

### LATER

- better video montage

## Source material

### Videos

All the videos are clips from the Amazon Original & BBC Studios tv show "Good Omens". I do not own those videos.

### Text

In the TV show, the bookshop displays a sign that reads as follow:

"I open the shop on most weekdays about 9:30 or perhaps 10am.
While occasionally I open the shop as early as 8, I have been known not to open until 1, except on Tuesday.
I tend to close about 3:30pm, or earlier if something needs tending to.
However, I might occasionally keep the shop open until 8 or 9 at night, you never know when you might need some light reading.
On days that I am not in, the shop will remain closed.
On weekends, I will open the shop during normal hours unless I am elsewhere.
Bank holidays will be treated in the usual fashion, with early closing on Wednesdays, or sometimes Fridays.
(For Sundays see Tuesdays)."

## Can I copy some ?

Sure ! This code is under the licence [TO_DEFINE]
